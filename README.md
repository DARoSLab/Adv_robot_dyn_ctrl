# Advanced Robot Dynamics and Control

This course covers advanced topics in robotics with a major focus on robotic systems' dynamics and control, which are crucial concepts to understand how robots move and interact with the physical world. We will learn how the complex kinematics and dynamics of a robot are defined, analyzed, and controlled by using Liegroup-based kinematics, Lagrangian dynamics, whole-body control, contact simulation, and actuator mechanism. Students will also learn Google Colab and Python programming to build simulation and analysis tools. 

Specific topics: actuator, homogenous transformation, forward and inverse kinematics, 3D orientation representation, Newtonian dynamics, Lagrangian dynamics, whole-body control, and contact dynamics. There will be in-class exercises, weekly homework/quizzes, one Midterm, and a final project.
